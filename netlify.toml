  # Directory to publish your static site from. Netlify will serve files under this
  # folder at the root of your domain. In this project the static front‑end is
  # contained in the `habit_tracker` folder.

# You can add more configuration options here if needed. For a simple static site
# there is no build command because the HTML, CSS and JS files live directly
# in the repository.
